This file contains a complete list of all files and directories on the 
distribution disks provided with this product.

==============================================================================

Files on the distribution disks are compressed (indicated by a "$" in the
file extension) and must be decompressed before they are used. The Setup
program on the "Setup" disk unpacks files as it installs them. A separate
file unpacking utility (UNPACK.EXE) located on the "Utilities" disk is
provided for manual file decompression. The following table displays the
compressed/uncompressed file extension mapping scheme:

   Compressed file extension:        Uncompressed file extension:
	    *.BA$               -             *.BAS
	    *.BI$               -             *.BI
	    *.CO$               -             *.COM
	    *.DA$               -             *.DAT
	    *.EX$               -             *.EXE
	    *.HL$               -             *.HLP
	    *.LI$               -             *.LIB
	    *.OB$               -             *.OBJ
	    *.PI$               -             *.PIF
	    *.QL$               -             *.QLB
                           
An example of using UNPACK.EXE to decompress a single file is as follows:

C:\> unpack a:qb.ex$ c:\qb45\qb.exe

This will decompress the QB.EX$ file from the distribution disk in drive a:
to the file QB.EXE in the C:\QB45 directory.

This package comes with a number of demonstration and utility programs
written in BASIC. These files are for informational and recreational
purposes only, and Microsoft makes no warranties, either expressed or
implied, as to their suitability for specific purposes or their correctness,
accuracy, or reliability. The entire risk as to the results and performance
of the software is assumed by you.

All files ending with the .BAS extension are QuickBASIC source files.
Programs with an asterisk (*) next to their names require a color-graphics
adapter to run.
